Hi! gprMax is such an awesome program, thanks for developing it.

Pardon me if this has been discussed before. Also,
feature-creep is bad, so it's totally reasonable 

The killer feature that Agilent ADS et al seem to have is the ability to do 
coupled simulations, with transient sims of lumped elements connected to microstrip.

OpenEMS also has some provisions for this in AddLumpedElement.m - it might be better to add this
to OpenEMS, since it's got a graded mesh.

It turns out to be really simple to integrate SPICE with FDTD [V.A. Thomas et al IEEE 1994],
and yields great results [Thomas]

[Sui 1992] uses simple analytic expressions for some lumped components; that works really well.
